# Toxic Tweet Detector

## Overview

This project aims to address the issue of violence and abuse against women on Twitter by developing a machine learning model to detect toxic tweets. Inspired by the research from Amnesty International, this tool helps identify and mitigate harmful content on the platform.

## Background

Twitter has become a toxic place for many women, with threats of violence, harassment, and discriminatory abuse being rampant. Amnesty International's research highlights the severity of this issue and the need for better measures to protect users.

## Features

- **Toxic Tweet Detection**: Uses natural language processing (NLP) techniques to classify tweets as toxic or non-toxic.
- **User-friendly Interface**: Built with Streamlit for ease of use.
- **Real-time Analysis**: Processes tweets in real-time for immediate feedback.

## Model

The model was trained using a labeled dataset of tweets, employing techniques such as CountVectorizer for text vectorization and various machine learning algorithms to achieve optimal performance.

## Usage

1. Enter the tweet you want to analyze in the input field.
2. Click on the "Analyze" button.
3. The application will display whether the tweet is toxic or non-toxic.
